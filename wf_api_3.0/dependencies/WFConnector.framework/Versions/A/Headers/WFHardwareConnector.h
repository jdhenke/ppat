 * each matching device which was discovered.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * If a real-time update is desired, the
 * WFHardwareConnectorDelegate::hardwareConnector:didDiscoverDevices:searchCompleted:
 * may be processed for each device, as it is discovered.  If real-time updates are

 *
 *  As of iOS 5.1, there is a bug in CoreBluetooth affecting devices which
 * require bonding.  In normal operation, the Wahoo API will run CoreBluetooth
 * on an alternate dispatch queue.  This is the default state, and allows for
 * efficient simultaneous connections with multiple BTLE devices.  However, when
 * a device requires bonding, CoreBluetooth prompts the user with an alert
 * dispatched on the alternate queue, rather than the main run loop,
 * causing the UI to freeze.  To work around this issue, the WF API allows the
 * developer to put the BTLE controller into "bonding" mode.  In this mode,
 * the bonding prompt is dispatched on the main run loop, so that the
 * UI performs as expected.
 *
 * @note <b>BONDING MODE SHOULD ONLY BE USED WHEN IT IS NECESSARY TO BOND A DEVICE
 * WHICH HAS NOT YET BEEN BONDED.</b>  Using this mode for normal operation may lead
 * to unstable behavior.
 *
 * The mode may be switched between normal and bonding via this method.  If BTLE
 * is enabled when this method is invoked, and a different mode is specified, the
 * BTLE controller will be reset and then enabled in the specified mode.  The
 * application will receive the WFHardwareConnectorDelegate::hardwareConnector:stateChanged:
 * message twice when switching modes.  The first will be for the reset, the
 * ::WF_HWCONN_STATE_BT40_ENABLED flag will be cleared.  The second is when the

 * Initializes a sensor connection request based on the specified parameters.

 * This method will initiate a connection request based on the specified
 * parameters, and return a WFSensorConnection instance which may be used to
 * manage the connection.  The connection process is asynchronous.  Unless
 * a sensor specified in the parameters is already connected, it is likely
 * that the sensor will not have connected when this method returns.
 *
 * The WFSensorConnection may be used to monitor the connection status.  There
 * are two ways to be notified when the sensor connection is established.  The
 * WFHardwareConnectorDelegate::hardwareConnector:connectedSensor: is invoked
 * whenever any sensor connection is established.  When using this method, the
 * connectionInfo parameter must be checked to determine which sensor has
 * connected (if multiple connections were requested).  The other option is
 * to set the WFSensorConnection::delegate property on the instance returned.
 * The delegate will be alerted to any change in the connection status.
 *
 * The WFSensorConnection class is an abstract base class for sensor connection
 * management.  The actual object type returned will be determined by the
 * WFConnectionParams::sensorType value.  It is recommended that the instance
 * returned be cast as the specific type, and then cached as an instance
 * member used for managing the connection.  The WFSensorConnection is used
 * to retrieve data from the sensor, as well as to disconnect, or monitor the
 * state of the connection.
 *
 * A best-practices outline for connecting to a heart rate monitor follows:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>Create a WFConnectionParams instance and set the
 * WFConnectionParams::sensorType property to <c>WF_SENSORTYPE_HEARTRATE</c></li>
 *
 * <li>Create a WFDeviceParams instance and set its values to a previously
 * paired heart rate monitor (see the WFSensorConnection documentation for
 * information about initial pairing).</li>
 *
 * <li>Assign the WFDeviceParams instance to the WFConnectionParams::device1
 * property.</li>
 *
 * <li>Repeat the last two steps for any other previously paired heart rate
 * monitors (up to four).  Just use the device2, device3, or device4 property
 * instead of device1 specified in the last step.</li>
 *
 * <li>Invoke the WFHardwareConnector::requestSensorConnection: method.</li>
 *
 * <li>Cast the return value as a WFHeartrateConnection and cache as an
 * instance member.</li>
 *
 * <li>Set the WFSensorConnection::delegate property.</li>
 *
 * <li>Once the connection has been established, use the
 * WFHeartrateConnection::getHeartrateData method to retrieve a WFHeartrateData
 * instance.  This instance will contain the latest heart rate data.</li>
 *
 * <li>When the heart rate monitor is no longer needed, use the
 * WFSensorConnection::disconnect method to end the connection.</li>
 *
 * <li>After the connection is ended, the
 * WFSensorConnectionDelegate::connection:stateChanged: method will be invoked.
 * Check that the WFSensorConnection::isConnected is <c>FALSE</c>.  Release
 * the previously cached WFSensorConnection instance.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * @param params A WFConnectionParams instance which specifies the connection
